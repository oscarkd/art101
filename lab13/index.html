        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p> This lab's challenge was to use for loops to create a list of
          numbers and change numbers with certain factors </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Problems</h3>
        <p> This lab was pretty straight forward. We were able to get
          our for loops to work easily. We found that adding to a string
          was much more simple than having many if else statements. At the
          end of the lab we had some syntax errors, but we were able to
          quickly resolve them.

      <div>
        <h3> Results </h3>
        <p> We made fields for the user to input the amount of loops,
          different factors, and the words that replace them. </p>
      </div>

      <div id="survey">
        <p>Enter a max number:<p>
        <input type="number" id="input"></input> <br>
        <p> Replace Numbers with factors of:</p>
        <input type="number" id="factor1" class = "factor"></input><br>
        <p> With the word: </p>
        <input type="text" id="name1"> </input> <br>
        <p> Replace Numbers with factors of:</p>
        <input type="number" id="factor2" class = "factor"></input>
        <p> With the word: </p>
        <input type="text" id="name2"> </input> <br>
        <p> Replace Numbers with factors of:</p>
        <input type="number" id="factor3" class = "factor"></input>
        <p> With the word: </p>
        <input type="text" id="name3"> </input> <br>
