      <h3>Challenge</h3>
      <p>This lab's challenge was to experiment with the debugger and breakpoints
        in our JavaScript to pause the program in order to find errors.

      <h3>Problems</h3
        <p>My lab partner and I did not have any previous errors in our programs
          so we did not fix any old labs or resubmit them. We decided to use the
          debugger on our last lab with loops.

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>Below are some screenshots of our lab with the debugger. We also experimented
        with breakpoints. We noticed that the debugger showed us the values of
        each variable as we stepped through the loop. This was very helpful as it
        allowed us to see the program evaluating our code step by step.
