		<h1>Challege</h1>
		<p>This lab's challege was to declare different types of variables
			and reference them in an output. Then in an html file we called
			the javascript code, printing out the javascript output in the html page.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="problem">
		<h1> Problems </h1>
		<p>We struggled with many small typos in our code. My page was referencing
			the CSS file for my homepage, resulting in unwanted styling. My code that
			refrenced the javascript file said scr istead of src. My parnter had
			a similar problem, his javafile said document.write1n with a 1 instead of
			an l. We eventaully worked out all our typo problems.
