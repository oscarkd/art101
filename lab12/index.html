      <h3>Challege</h3>
      <p> This lab's challenge was to use Conditionals such as the if/else and
        else if statements to come up with a output dictated by the input.

      <h3>Problems</h3>
        <p> This lab went pretty smoothly with the guidance from our TA section.
          We had a few problems with typos when linking files and an error in our
          comment block that caused an error.</p>

      <h3>Results</h3>
        <p> We made a program that sorts you into a Hogwarts house based on your name</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <input type="text" id ="input"> Please enter your name for sorting </input>

      <button id="button">Submit</button>
