      <h3>Challenge</h3>
      <p> This lab's challenge was to print comics from XKCD comics API.</p>

      <h3>Problems</h3>
      <p> This lab was challenging. We figured out most of the code relating to the
        comic and got it to print out successfully. However, when we tried to buttons
        to go forward and backwards, our buttons would not function at all when clicked.
        We didn't figure out this problem, even when we put a console log in our button
        function nothing printed in the console. We think this problem has to do with the
        clickablity of the button. We also had problems with a console error that was
        fixed when we remebered to enable the chrome plugin.</p>
