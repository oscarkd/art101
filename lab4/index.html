		<h3>Challege</h3>
		<p> This lab's challege was to create pseudocode for an everyday task
			that not everyone is familiar with, then create pseudocode for a task
			specifically for a computer.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="problems">
		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p> It was hard to find a task to write pseudocode for.
			We first worked on pseudocode on the process of moving residency. This included
			steps such as finding roommates which included sub-steps like meeting them
			and testing compatability. We decided that this task was too open ended and
			not a task that was "everyday" enough. We decided to choose the task of changing
			a bike tire instead. When writing the pseudocode, we struggled with formatiing
			the indentations, but eventaully organized it.
	</div>
<div id="results">
		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p> For our everyday task (first section), we wrote detailed pseudocode for how to change
			and fix a bike tire. For the computer task (second section), we made pseudocode for a rock,
			paper, scissors game that has the user play against the computer.
