	<h1> Lab 3 </h1>
	<div>
		<h4> Lab Subject </h4>
		<p>In this lab, we learned about file structure and how to use
			html to navagate and access the files.
	</div>
	<div>
		<h4> Challenges </h4>
		<p>I had a hard time linking my image. I didn't know what was
		wrong with it until I discovered that I wrote img scr instead of
	img src. One group member had difficult moving their image file onto Atom without
	extra help.
 </p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h4> Results </h4>
		<p>Both team members successfully set up a basic homepage that included a heading, picture,
		and lab links. Each of our structures include div tags, paragraph tags, and heading tags.
